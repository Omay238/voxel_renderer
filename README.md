# voxel renderer
###### it's probably no good.

this is a voxel raytracer written in rust with wgpu and winit. i've never done anything like this before, so this is
largely for learning, but hey, it would be fun to try, so i am. this type of thing has been done a million times before,
but i haven't so i will.
